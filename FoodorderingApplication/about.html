We're proud to offer the highest quality, freshest diner food on The Main Line. From our family to yours, we put lots of love and careful attention in each item. We hope you enjoy our work as much as we enjoy bringing it to you.

A local favorite since 1971, Minells offers an extensive menu with everything imaginable at a diner, including salads, soups, soft drinks, desserts, breakfast foods, eggs, pancakes, waffles, hot and cold sandwiches, burgers, wraps, seafood, steak, plus Italian and Greek specialties.

All baking is done on the premises, and credit cards are accepted. We also offer a full bar menu.

It's our honor to serve you. Welcome and enjoy!
